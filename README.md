# astroStatsHOWTOsDearborn
Informal HOWTOs for data analysis and statistics in astronomy. Written for the UM-Dearborn Astronomy research group and aimed at an undergraduate level.

The original versions of these notebooks can be found at my personal
webspace at UM-Dearborn: ([Informal statistics HOWTOs](http://www-personal.umd.umich.edu/~wiclarks/ASTRGroup/StatsSeminars/index.html))
and also
([Astronomy/computing HOWTOs](http://www-personal.umd.umich.edu/~wiclarks/AstroLab/HOWTOs/HOWTO_iPython.html#MC_Errors)). Those
notebooks are now more than six years old and are in need of updating! This Github repository will hold the updated versions.
