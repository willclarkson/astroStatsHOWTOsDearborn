# astroStatsHOWTOsDearborn
Informal HOWTOs for data analysis and statistics in astronomy. Written for the UM-Dearborn Astronomy research group and aimed at an undergraduate level.

The original versions of these notebooks can be found at my personal
webspace atUM-Dearborn
(http://www-personal.umd.umich.edu/~wiclarks/ASTRGroup/StatsSeminars/index.html)
and also
[here](http://www-personal.umd.umich.edu/~wiclarks/AstroLab/HOWTOs/HOWTO_iPython.html#MC_Errors). Those
notebooks are now more than seven years old and should be updated:
this Github repository will hold the updated versions.

Subdirectories:

**notebooks/** - Jupyter notebooks with the HOWTOs.

**notebooks/html** - .html renderings of the Jupyter notebooks.
